# Linear mapping — agent-system work-items → Linear (canonical)

**Status:** canonical map (generalises and supersedes the inline mapping in
`process/improvement-slices/IMP-014-linear-plan-progress-board.md`, which mapped
only the single OagEventSource product into one team).

**Purpose.** A **one-way state mirror**, agent-system → Linear, that gives humans
a plan + live-progress board. **No DORA, no estimates, no token cost** — metrics
stay in the ledger as the SSOT for retros (explicit human decision, IMP-014).
Linear has no custom fields anyway.

---

## 1. Teams = projects

One Linear **team per `work/<project>`**. Excluded by decision: `ox` (oxo),
`oxo-online`, `observatory`.

| `work/` project | Linear team | key |
|---|---|---|
| OagEventSource | OagEventSource | `OAG` |
| viggo-fix | Viggo-Fix | `VIG` |
| _(future, via `/project-new`)_ | one new team each | — |

**`IMP-*` process-improvement work is NOT on Linear** (no "Agent System" team).
It is the agent's own self-state — SSOT is `/process` (`improvement-slices/`,
`experiments.md`, `principle-failures/`, the DORA ledger), deliberately
project-agnostic (the §F10 shared spine). Linear mirrors human-facing *delivery*
per project; process improvement is the system improving itself, not delivery,
and its metrics never go to Linear. If a specific `IMP-*` becomes a substantial
build, it is handled as work inside a project, not a standing board.

`_TEMPLATE` is scaffolding — not a team.

**Canonical: one Linear team per `work/` project.** `OagEventSource` is its own
team, `viggo-fix` its own team, etc. Per-project `.linear-config.json` sets that
project's `teamId`; the reconciler (paths resolve from its own location) builds
the whole tree in that team.

**Blocked only by API-key scope (not the plan).** Creating teams needs an API
key with **team-admin permission** (a member-scoped key returns `Access denied`;
a plan cap returns `limit of teams … upgrade`). Until a team-create-capable key
is in place, a project falls back to its own **Initiative inside the shared
team** (the IMP-014 model) — same reconciler, `teamId` = shared, distinct
`initiativeName`. **Promote a project to its own team** (once the key allows) in
three steps: (1) `teamCreate` the team; (2) set that project's
`.linear-config.json` `teamId` to the new team id; (3) re-run `--live` (builds
the tree in the new team) then `--prune` the project's old shared-team initiative
projects. Currently: OagEventSource = team `OAG` ("OagEventFeed"); viggo-fix =
interim initiative in that team, awaiting its own team.

## 2. Hierarchy — the work-item tree (`items/items.csv`)

The REQ▸CHK▸SLC▸UC tree maps 1:1 onto Linear's four nesting levels.

| Framework | id prefix | Linear object | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **requirement** | `REQ-` | **the Team itself** | 1 requirement per project = 1 team; the team name/description IS the product. No separate object. |
| **chunk** | `CHK-` | **Project** | groups slices; lives in the project's team |
| **slice** | `SLC-` | **Milestone** | the shippable value unit, inside its chunk-Project |
| **use-case** | `UC-` | **Issue** | the atomic deliverable; the unit of pull |

**No Initiatives.** A Linear Initiative is a **cross-team / multi-project
portfolio** grouping — the wrong construct here: each requirement is one
self-contained project = one team, with nothing above it to group. We have no
work that spans teams, so an initiative-per-project would misuse the construct
(a portfolio of one). If a genuine cross-project programme ever exists, an
Initiative grouping those teams' projects is the right place for it — not before.

**Titling rule for composite-id chunks.** Some chunks carry a composite id from
JIT replenishment (`CHK-5-SLC-024`, `CHK-9-SLC-026`, …) rather than a clean
`CHK-N`. The sync keys on the raw `id` (so each is still its own Project, no
dupes) but **titles the Project by the chunk's slice outcome, not the raw id** —
e.g. `CHK-5-SLC-024` → "Master-data live adapter", read from `chunks.md` /
`dora_ref`. Clean `CHK-N` ids keep their `CHK-N · <name>` title.

```
Team: OagEventSource                    (REQ — the team is the product)
  Project:  CHK-3 Normalise             (CHK)
    Milestone: SLC-008                  (SLC)
      Issue:   UC-EB5   [In Progress]   (UC)
        └─ sub-issue: DEFECT-OAG-010    (defect against UC-EB5)
```

## 2a. Issue content — human title, why, acceptance (REQUIRED)

Every UC Issue MUST carry, **mirrored from the use-case's artifact, never invented
at sync time** (process §12d):

- **Title** — `UC-x · <human title>`, the use-case heading (falls back to
  `UC-x — <job>` only when no artifact title exists).
- **Description** (markdown) — a **Why this matters** section (the use-case's
  observable outcome / value + `Value`/`Job`) followed by an **Acceptance
  criteria** list (the `AC-…` cases it pins).

Source = the project's `slices/<n>/use-cases.md` (per-UC block: heading title,
"Observable outcome", "Acceptance cases" — bullet OR Given/When/Then table) with
`slices/<n>/acceptance.md` as the AC fallback (rows attributed to their UC by
**AC-id stem**, e.g. `AC-28a`→`UC-28`). Parsers are deterministic — see
`scripts/sync-linear.py` (`load_uc_content`). A UC with **no acceptance criteria
anywhere** gets the **`needs-acceptance`** label and an honest "none found" note
— the gap is surfaced, **never fabricated** — and is **not Ready** to build.

Defects carry a defect-as-spec description pointing at their `defects/<id>.md`
(Expected/Actual/Intent), not UC acceptance.

## 2b. Project content — chunk JTBD value (REQUIRED)

Every chunk Project MUST carry its **JTBD value** (process §11b), mirrored from
the CHK-keyed "## JTBD value per chunk" blocks in `chunks.md`:

- **Project `content`** (markdown body) — **Job to be done** + **Who gets
  value** / **What they can now do** / **Why this takes priority**.
- **Project `description`** (short card summary) — the value at a glance
  (`who: what-now`).

A chunk whose value is not articulated (missing who / what-now / why) gets an
explicit **`⚠ JTBD value not articulated — not prioritisable`** body and summary
— surfaced, **never fabricated**. Parser: `parse_chunk_values` in
`scripts/sync-linear.py`. (Linear Projects take no labels, so the flag lives in
the body/summary, not a label.)

**Project title** = `CHK-N · <name> — <purpose>`: keep the chunk id + mechanism
name, then append the block's **Purpose** (a few words of WHY, not what), so the
board title conveys value, not mechanism (process §11b).

## 2c. Blocked items show WHY (comment + description, both ways)

When an item is **Blocked**, the board says why and says so again when it clears
(process §F7a). Source: `items/blocks.csv` (`item,reason`), maintained by the
flow-manager on block/unblock. The sync mirrors it:
- **Description** gets a **🚫 Blocked: <why>** banner prepended while Blocked.
- A one-time **🚫 Blocked** comment is posted on entering Blocked (and again if
  the reason changes); an **✅ Unblocked — now <status>** comment when the
  `blocks.csv` row is removed. Idempotent via the local cache (`blocked` map).

Applies to UC issues and defect issues alike.

## 3. Non-tree item types → sub-issues / labelled issues

| Framework | id prefix | Lives in | Linear | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **defect** | `DEFECT-` | `defects/` | **sub-issue of the UC it is against** | label `defect`. Defect-as-spec: it hangs off its parent UC. |
| **open-item** (UC-scoped) | `OI-` | `open-items.md` | **sub-issue of that UC** | label `open-item` |
| **open-item** (slice/chunk-scoped) | `OI-` | `open-items.md` | **Issue** in the relevant Milestone/Project | label `open-item` |
| **capability** | `CICD-`/`CAP-` | `capabilities.md` | **Issue** under the chunk-Project, Milestone = slice it enables | label `cicd` / `infra` |
| **improvement-slice** | `IMP-` | `/process` | **NOT mirrored to Linear** — self-state, SSOT is `/process` (§1) | — |

The `defects/` folder uses `DEFECT-OAG-NNN`; the `open-items.md` `OI-NNN` rows
carry a `slice` column — that column decides whether the open-item attaches to a
UC (sub-issue) or to a slice/chunk (issue at that level).

## 4. Workflow states (= the queue model)

The four queues (**Intake → Ready → Deploy → Rework**) plus the derived item
states (`planned / in-flight / done`, from `state.md`) collapse to a single
Linear status set, applied to **Issues** (UCs/defects/etc.):

| Linear status | Source state |
|---|---|
| **Backlog** | in `intake` queue / `planned` |
| **Ready** | in `ready` queue |
| **In Progress** | `in-flight` (engineer building) |
| **In Review** | tester / validate-in-prod |
| **Blocked** | §F5 deploy gate, collision, or `rework` queue |
| **Done** | `item_done` ledger event |

Done bubbles **up** (process §F): a slice's Milestone is done when all its UCs
are done; a chunk's Project when its done-condition is met; the requirement's
Initiative when all chunks are done.

## 5. Labels

**Type/flow:** `defect` · `open-item` · `cicd` / `infra` · `gate:deploy` · `blocked` · `needs-acceptance` (UC with no acceptance criteria in its artifact — not Ready)

**Job-to-be-done:** `job:<Jn>` — every tree item (Initiative/Project/Milestone/
Issue) carries a label for its `job` column from `items.csv` (`job:J0`, `job:J3`,
…) so humans can filter the board by JTBD. The `job` *code* is the only thing
that crosses over; the JTBD prose stays in `project.md`/vision, not Linear.

## 6. Sync mechanics — idempotent one-way reconciler

- **Direction:** agent-system → Linear only. Humans read the board; they do not
  edit state back (preserves the single-writer ledger invariant, STATE-MODEL.md).
- **Trigger:** runs **each inner-dev-loop cycle** (`/loop-run`) so the board
  self-updates as UCs are pulled / built / shipped / gated. Seed once, then auto.
- **Reads:** `items/items.csv` (REQ▸CHK▸SLC▸UC tree) + `state.md` / queues
  (current per-item state).
- **Idempotency:** a per-project cache mapping canonical `id → linear-id`
  (initiative/project/milestone/issue). Re-running reconciles in place — no dupes.
  Canonical id (`UC-…`, `SLC-…`) is also embedded in the Linear title for humans.
- **Script:** `scripts/sync-linear.py` (per IMP-014), config-driven per project
  (`.linear-config.json`: `teamId` + `initiativeName`); paths resolve from the
  script's own project folder. `IMP-*` is not synced (§1).

## 6b. Reconciliation is two-way — remove, not just create

A reconciler that only *creates* lets every sync bug accumulate cruft (a bad
run once left 15 orphan/duplicate chunk Projects). So the sync also **removes
what the SSOT no longer connects to**:
- **Inline (each run):** a chunk that leaves `items.csv` has its Project archived
  and its milestones dropped (`--live` reconcile).
- **`--prune` (one-off / periodic):** archives every Project **in this project's
  initiative** whose id is not a current cache value — orphans/duplicates the
  cache lost track of. Dry-run lists; `--live` archives. **Scoped to our own
  initiative**, so a co-tenant project (another project's initiative in the
  shared team) is never touched. Run `--prune` after any sync problem, rename,
  or id change that could strand a Project.

Principle: *connected to the SSOT* is the only reason a Linear entity should
exist; anything else is removed.

## 7. What deliberately does NOT go to Linear

DORA metrics, value/cost/`vc_ratio`, token cost, estimates, queue dwell times.
All of it stays in the append-only ledger; retros read it there. Linear is a
human-facing **plan + progress** view, nothing more.
